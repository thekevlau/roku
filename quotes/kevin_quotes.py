# some times the feedback loop is simple.
# when you fail, there's no need to look back and go through this ego-centric crisis of "how did i fail?" "i've done it before." "i expected better of you."

# No. the key here is you failed and you messed up. Ok. This means you are doing *something* wrong. Your process that you've been developing up until this point didn't work, or rather it isn't working anymore. Ok. So that means you have to fix it. Change things up. Try something new. Adapt.

# interesting questions:
# what makes people interesting?
# what interesting things are people working on?
# role models-- they are interesting.

# keep thinking about the world, in interesting new ways
# find new and intriuging patterns, which your mind is built to do
