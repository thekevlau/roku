# some times the feedback loop is simple.
# when you fail, there's no need to look back and go through this ego-centric crisis of "how did i fail?" "i've done it before." "i expected better of you."

# No. the key here is you failed and you messed up. Ok. This means you are doing *something* wrong. Your process that you've been developing up until this point didn't work, or rather it isn't working anymore. Ok. So that means you have to fix it. Change things up. Try something new. Adapt.
