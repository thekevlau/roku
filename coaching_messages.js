/* Product Question: what is the best interval for getting these?
    once per day for all, but what about specific types?
    Precedence:
        1) Repeated Values
        2) Current State and Goals
        3) Life Lesson Reminders
        4) Motivation <-- this gets old real quick.
        I respond better to actionable things.
        Also the top 3 are things I want to always keep top of mind, so repeating them is fine.
        In fact, if i get bored of them it means they're very firmly rooted in my mind, which is a good thing.

    // Reminders for Key Life Lessons
    "It is important to regularly stop, re-orient and re-focus on one's goals. This is how one achieves long term focus.",
    "Discipline opens the doors to infinite possibilities. Stay sharp.",
    "You can learn anything. You were built for learning!",
    "Devote yourself to the perfection of today's tasks.",
    "The ability to focus is what differentiates the top 1%",
    "You don't rise to the level of your hopes, you fall to the level your training",
    "Always be the weakest person in the room and focus on sponging from everyone else. Revel in your failure as it is the symptom of growth.",
    "To be able to endure the pain of being a repeated failure is not strength. To be strong is when you are able to achieve success once again. To stand back up after repeated failure and achieve success once again.",
    // If you can adhere to a 5-year plan that you set today, you aren't living up to your potential.
    "You must be an A+ in order to accomplish a C-level, 5 year plan entirely.",
    "If it seems like you're doing everything right and you're killing the game all the time, you aren't pushing yourself hard enough.",
    "It takes 120% to reach 100%",
    "Be determined through calm-- meet situations without tenseness, yet not recklessly. Your spirited settled, yet unbiased.",
    "Success is 99% HARD WORK. Sit down. Shut up. Suck it up and get back to work.",
    "If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude. Don't complain.",

    // Motivation
    "Be better than you were yesterday.",
    "110% every day. Exceed your limits and grow-- Plus Ultra.",
    "It's about how much you can get hit, and still get back up and keep going.",
    "Good effort today. Do better tomorrow.",
    "Proud, but never Satisfied.",
    "There is no battle you cannot win, but also no battle you will win for sure.",

    // High Level Coach Style Reminders and Feedback- My Current State and Goals
    "You are putting off the Art of War in order to focus on school right now. Focus on crushing it.",
    "School comes first. Then comes job seeking. Studying the interesting stuff-- finance, badminton, strategy is the reward to follow.",

    // Things I wish to always be at the top of my conciousness
    // Things I want to repeat to myself over and over again so that I don't forget.
    "Being highly specific in your process may seem like BS, but there is value in being very explicit and specific in everything that you do.",
    "Yes you need R&R, but first, we can push the psyche's limits of razor focused effort",
    "The ultimate goal is intimidating, overwhelmingly dominant work ethic.",
    "Fear of vulnerability and humiliation-- ego -- is your biggest bottleneck.",
    "I want a work ethic that can strike fear into the hearts of enemies. A reputation.",
    // better than this, is the confidence that you can accomplish anything.

    // On Respect, and self-respect:
    // http://www.innergladiator.com/demanding-respect/
    "In order to be heard, you must first listen.",
    // ^ Listen to them first, then they will like you. And when they like you, they'll listen to you in return. And when they listen, they will resepct.
    "It’s not about demanding or gaining respect from a person — it’s about becoming a respectable person yourself.",
    "In order to become respected, you must first respect yourself.",
    // ^ And respecting yourself entails becoming a person you can respect, first. And to do that:
    "Strive to create more value than you consume. People will see that you’re putting in effort in your life, that you’re a responsible person, and that you go after what you want. Live your values."
        /* ^ When your peers see that, they’d gladly help you out when you need it.
            They’ll listen to you.
            They’ll know your values and will know to treat you with the respect you deserve, even if you aren’t the “nicest” guy.
